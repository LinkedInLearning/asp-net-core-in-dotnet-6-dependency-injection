![ASP.NET Core in .NET 6: Dependency Injection][lil-thumbnail-url] 

If you’re a .NET developer or looking to enter the field, it’s essential to have a working understanding of dependency injection, a software development design pattern that allows for having objects that are not dependent on each other. In this course, .NET C# programmer David Grace provides an introduction to dependency injection, from configuration to implementation. He also talks through the advantages of DI and why you should use it. David shows how to implement dependency injection into a real-life example using an ASP.NET Core app, and details the use methods within it. He also looks at the common errors when using dependency injection and how to resolve them.

## Instructions
This repository has branches for each of the videos in the course. You can use the branch pop up menu in github to switch to a specific branch and take a look at the course at that stage, or you can add `/tree/BRANCH_NAME` to the URL to go to the branch you want to access.

## Branches
The branches are structured to correspond to the videos in the course. The naming convention is `CHAPTER#_MOVIE#`. As an example, the branch named `02_03` corresponds to the second chapter and the third video in that chapter. 
Some branches will have a beginning and an end state. These are marked with the letters `b` for "beginning" and `e` for "end". The `b` branch contains the code as it is at the beginning of the movie. The `e` branch contains the code as it is at the end of the movie. The `main` branch holds the final state of the code when in the course.

When switching from one exercise files branch to the next after making changes to the files, you may get a message like this:

    error: Your local changes to the following files would be overwritten by checkout:        [files]
    Please commit your changes or stash them before you switch branches.
    Aborting

To resolve this issue:
	
    Add changes to git using this command: git add .
	Commit changes using this command: git commit -m "some message"
